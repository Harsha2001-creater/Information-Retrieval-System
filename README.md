**# Information Retrieval System**

## Overview
The **Information Retrieval System** is designed to efficiently search, rank, and retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. This project implements key information retrieval techniques to improve search accuracy and performance.

## Features
- **Efficient Search Mechanism**: Supports keyword-based search using TF-IDF, BM25, or vector-based retrieval.
- **Ranking Algorithm**: Implements scoring techniques to rank documents based on relevance.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal for optimized search.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Provides a user-friendly UI for query input and result visualization.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended with Elasticsearch or other indexing solutions for handling large datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Flask (for web interface), Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas
- **Search Techniques**: TF-IDF, BM25, Word Embeddings (if applicable)
- **Frameworks**: Flask (backend), Jupyter Notebooks (for research and trials)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Information-Retrieval-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Information-Retrieval-System
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Enter a search query in the UI.
- The system retrieves and ranks relevant documents.
- Displays top results with relevance scores.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Elasticsearch** for better scalability.
- **Support for multi-language queries** using transformers.
- **Improved UI/UX** with interactive result filtering.
